    "## What is a Geosoft database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Geosoft database stores 3D spatial data in a form that allows for both very-large volume data storage and very efficient processing.  Geosoft databases are stored on a file system in a file that has extension _.gdb_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Geosoft database was first designed in 1992 and has evolved to become a de facto standard for airborne and ground geophysical data, geochemical data, and drillhole data of all kinds.  All Geosoft programs and third-party applications that use the Geosoft API to read databases are able to work with databases created by any version of Geosoft since 1992, though database features and capabilities that are newer than the reading program will not be available to older programs. This cross-version stability of data has been key to the emergence of Geosoft databases as an industry standard, especially for airborne geophysical surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, Geosoft databases store located data which has either an (x, y) location for 2D data, or an (x, y, z) location for 3D data such that each location may have any number of fields of associated information.  Information fields are referred to as 'channels' in the context of a Geosoft Database, and channels may contain numeric data, strings or arrays of numeric data to store things like time-series.  For example an airborne magnetic survey may have (x, y, elevation, altimeter, mag) data, and a ground geochemical survey may contain (x, y, elevation, Cu, Au, Hg).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in a database is grouped into the concept of 'lines' of data such that each 'line' contains the data from a single airborne survey line, a single ground survey line, a marine ship track, a set of data from a single drill hole, or from any other grouping construct that is suitable for the stored data.  Geosoft's desktop application, Oasis montaj, displays a single line of data in a spreadsheet-like form to the user, allowing a user to change lines and change which channels are displayed and the order channels are displayed. Simple databases might place all data into a single line.  All lines in a Geosoft database share the channel definitions, of course with data different for each line. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the exercises in this tutorial you will be introduced to other concepts of Geosoft databases."

This is part of the low-level [geosoft.gxapi](https://geosoftinc.github.io/gxpy/9.3/python/geosoft.gxapi.classes.html#geosoft-gxapi-classes) so a bit more care is required. Database functions often require locks on database symbols (handles to lines, channels and other database objects), which is the case for the _Line_, _x_ch_ and _y_ch_ arguments of split_line_xy2. Because Geosoft databases allow for concurrent access by multiple applications, symbols must be locked and unlocked as they are used.  The `geosoft.gxpy` pythonic api will do this for you, but the `geosoft.gxapi` requires that you directly manage locks. Terminating a script removes any locks that may have remained on any symbols."
