    "## What is a Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "A grid is a form of spatial data that represents information (such as a gravity intensity, a magnetic reading, or a colour) at points organized as a 2-dimensional array on a right-handed cartesian plane:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/GeosoftInc/gxpy/raw/9.3/examples/tutorial/Grids%20and%20Images/image2017-6-14_13-9-19.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The plane on which the grid is located can be oriented in three dimensions relative to a Coordinate System on the Earth.  The most common grids are located on a horizontal surface relative to the Coordinate System.  For example, common surfaces might be sea-level, or the ground surface, or a constant elevation above or below the ground surface, or a constant elevation. Vertical cross-sections through the Earth are oriented to be orthogonal to the surface of the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common term used with grids is the concept of a 'grid cell'.  In Geosoft's usage, grids are an array of points at a point location, and a 'grid cell' is the rectangular area that extends half-way to the neighboring grid points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial reference angles throughout the _geosoft.gxpy_ module will consistently use an angle in degrees azimuth, which is a clockwise-positive angle relative to a coordinate system frame (North, or positive Y). The _geosoft.gxapi.GXIMG_ class specifies the rotation angle in degrees counterclockwise-positive, and other references within the geosoft.gxapi may differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grids are stored as files on the file system, and there are many common grid file formats in existence. When working with grid files in GX Developer you define the grid file format with the use of a decorator string appended to the grid file name. Geosoft supports the 11 formats (and their many derivatives) described in the Grid File Name Decorations section of the GX Developer documentation.  For example:\n",

Let's modify this script to set the coordinate system, which will be saved as part of the ER Mapper grid, which does have the ability to store  the coordinate system description.\n",

In this example we will iterate through all points in the grid and accumulate the statistics a point at a time.  This is the least-efficient way to work through a grid, but the pattern can be useful to deal with a very simple need.  For example, any Geosoft supported grid can be easily converted to an ASCII file that has lists the (x, y, z, grid_value) for all points in a grid."
