Introduction
============

This is the Python API reference documentation for the Geosoft GX API (and gxpy), which is part of Geosoft GX Developer.
The complete GX Developer programming guide can be found in a separate on-line document:
`GX Developer Guide <https://geosoftgxdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GD/overview>`__.
The programming guide is available as a separate version for each released version of GX Developer. Refer to the
documentation version that matches the API version noted at the top of this page.

The GX API has two parts:

    1.  The **Geosoft GX API** provides the full low-level library of functions available to all languages,
        including Python.  The Geosoft GX API is exposed to python developers through the
        :ref:`geosoft.gxapi modules <geosoft.gxapi.classes>`.

    2.  The **Geosoft gxpy API** is a set of :ref:`Python modules... <gxpy>` that provides a
        Pythonic abstraction of key parts of the underlying GX API.  This hides much of the complexity of
        the low-level GX API, while still providing low-level access where necessary. The coding of the
        gxpy Python modules also provides an invaluable reference for how to work with the low-level
        libraries.
